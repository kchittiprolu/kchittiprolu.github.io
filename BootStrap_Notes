Summary:
--------

Bootstrap 3 Grid system is 12 column layout.
Bootstrap grid layouts are avialable for different types of devices like 
	Extra smalle devices (like cell phones <768px)	class prefix = .col-xs-    ; Grid behavior = 'horizontal at all times'
	Small devices (Tables >= 768px)					class prefix = .col-sm-	   ; Collapsed to start, horizontal above breakpoints
	Medium devices (Desktops >=992px)				class prefix = .col-md-	   ; Collapsed to start, horizontal above breakpoints
	Large devices (Desktops >=1200px)				class prefix = .col-lg-    ; Collapsed to start, horizontal above breakpoints


Since bootstrap grid system is based on 12 columns, so to keep the columns in a one line (i.e. side by side), the sum of the grid column numbers in each row should be equal to 12.

e.g; The below example creates a container with a row containing 3 column grids.

<div class="container">
    <!--Row with three equal columns-->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4"><!--Column left--></div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><!--Column middle--></div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><!--Column right--></div>
    </div>
</div>

class ="clear-fix visible-md-block" is used to fix alignment issues in case of one column having height more than other. The responsive utility class .visible-md-block makes the .Clearfix class effective only on medium size devices and it is hidden on other devices.


BootStrap Responsive Utilities classes:
---------------------------------------
You can use the following responsive classes to enable the visibility of elements on certain devices that screen size falls with the specific range.

.visible-xs-*  : makes the element visible only on extra small devices having screen less than 768px.
.visible-sm-*  : display only on small devices.
.visible-md-*
.visible-lg-*

You can also mix the above classes to make the elements visible on multiple devices. For e.g. you can apply the class .visible-xs-* and .visible-md-* on any element to make it visible on extra small and medium devices.


.hidden-xs : use to hide an element on exta small devices. Similar class can be used to hide elements on medium, large devices.
